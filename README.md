# Vehicle inventory manager.

This program allows the users (A car Dealership) to enter data about the cars that they aquire. After the users input the information the vehicle is backed up in a MySQL database.
Because the data is backed up and saved the dealership can also sell vehicles and permanently rid them from the database. 

//The code I wrote is in VehicleProject/FinalProject/src/sample/controller.java

//There is also a css stylesheet that is very simple in the src file.

//The database I connected to was stored in the database at msum so to run this program I need to connect to a vpn to access the colleges data.
